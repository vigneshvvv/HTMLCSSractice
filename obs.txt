The main HTML will have <head> and <body>
 
by default we will have body and inside that only we will be seperating header and footer 
inside body only we will be sepearing header and footer

inside head we will be defining script, css file 

<link> used to mention the style sheet.. icon etc 

<link rel = "stylesheet", href="style.css">

rel - stands for relationship

we have two different types applying style like we have for id we will mention

#para1 

here para1 we have defined as id 

.para1 

para1 is defined inside class 

p.para1 means if we have given class name para1 for <p> and <div> then we are telling apply style to only <p> that's why 
we are giving p.para1 if i give only .para1 alone then it will apply to both <p> and <div> tags

color = to set color for font 
background color = background colour of h or everything
border = 2px solid red  (here fist one is size of border, solid measn type of border and red is colour of border)

rgb , hash value = like this we can give colours

background color ca be set for div etc
and we can set opacity - which means transparency

 background: rgba(0, 128, 0, 0.3)  here 0.3 is transparency
------------------------
 <head>
    
    <title>Main Page</title>
    <!-- <link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="favicon.ico"> -->
     <link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="favicon.ico">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>

the title is like when i give this will be applied to tab name 
if i give icon on link it will be image aplied to your tab 
mae sure not to give anything like h1 inside your head tag

---------------------

we have contetn area and it has border 

after border we have padding 
adding used to increase the inside space of the content 
margin is the outside area of the border 

it will come in alignment like 

border-top
boder-right
border-left
border-bottom 

(10px, 25px, 10px)

this will mean like border-top,border-rightand border-left, border bottom

box-sizing: border-box it will udjust the padding and width automatically

width and max-width if we set as width: 500 px  then if we go to smaller pages the 500x will be same and add scroll bar 
the look won't be nice that's why what we have to do is set 

max-width: 500 px in this case if the screen becomes smaller then html will adapt to it 

---------------------------------------
table,th,td{
    border-collapse: collapse;
    border: 1px solid;
    table-layout: fixed;
    width: 100%;
    text-align: center;
    /* vertical-align: bottom; */
}

here  border-collapse: collapse; intitally border will be aplied for all round the box 
if we give sollae then we will get all single border

table-layout: fixed means when width increased every column will be of same width
text-align to align the center
-----------------------------------

table{
    table-layout: fixed;
    min-width: 1200px;
    width: 100%;
    border-collapse: collapse;
}
th,td{
  border-bottom: 1px solid;
  padding: 25px;
  text-align: center;
}
tr:nth-child(even){
    background-color: #C4C7C6;
}
th{
    background-color: #1DC711;
    color: white;
}
.TableContext{
    overflow-x: auto;
    max-width: 100%;
}

here 

.TableContext - is div content 
table is our table 

here we are fixing width to 100% which is your screen size 
  overflow-x: auto; which means if content increases content can overflow and become scrollable 

  in table i am givind width as 100% and min-width as 1200ps if it goes beyond then page become scrollable 

-----------------------------------------------------------
Block level elements   

<div>
<h1>
<p>
<form>
<header>
<footer>
<section>

initially block level element takes full width 

to change this we use 

Display: inline-block;

it will align multiple divin horizontal way 

if we give display as inline for bloack level element like above tags then it will align horizontally

if you apply display as bloack to inline element like span then it will act as block element

now 

inline-block  === we will have <p>  tag inside that we have <span> in that case the span will act like inline
nut if we fix width what happens is if will show like overlapped to <p> tag 

if we give inline-block 

then in that case we can set width and that inline will be good and other things around the <span> will also
have same things

Display: flex 

it will align fkexibly 

when we give flex-direction: column then vertically aligns 

<ul> has row direction by default 

--------------------

----------------------

next is position  -- position is position of element 
use www.programiz.com/css/position

if i give position: static 

then it will go by the flow of html and even if i give width, height then these things will be null wont have any effect
on the flow 

position is static by default so what ever you use top,bottom,right,left  it wont affect anything 

if you change position to relative then you would be able to use these proertis to osition your elements

position:absolute

position: fixed means eve if you scrolldown the age the posistion wont change it will remain fixed
